Compile the program with the -g flag
	cc -g {files}

Run gdb
	gdb {Program_name}

lay src
	go to the source layout

Breakpoints tell the debugger when to stop running the code and to go into step by step mode
	break/b {func_name}	This will break at a certain function
	break/b {file_name}:{line_number} This will break at a certain line on a file

run/r (optional){cmd_arg1} {cmd_arg2} {cmd_arg...}
	Now we need to start running the program, you can do this with the run command

next/n
	With the step over command you will you go over the code, executing any function calls when they appear

kill
	To stop the currently running program

quit
	To quit gdb

if you want to rerun the program from the start you can just do the run/r command again

# TIP, if you want to re-enter the same command, you can just press enter without typing anything
